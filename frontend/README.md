Freelancer platform is designed for self employed people (especially freelancer and customer). These people can make contacts with each other and work on some project or task together (in our system it's called advert) by agreement and keep in touch.

Also Freelancer platform allows to navigate on website without any delays and problems.

Our team is proud that we made simple and in the same time efficient filter by adverts, so anybody can find anything that is suit for him.

Customer is able to create advert and apply some freelancer on it from his response on advert.

And on the other hand freelancer is allowed to leave response on advert and if he's applied, he's able to work on that advert.

Worth to mention that our platform is made with new technologies, so it's unlikely you to have bad experience with it.
